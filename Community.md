# Community

If you are an [ohloh](http://www.ohloh.net) user, please consider adding GPars
to you [ohloh stack](https://www.ohloh.net/p/gpars).

## Mailinglists

Two public Google Groups exist, which serve as mailing lists, and can
be used to search archives and post online:

[gpars-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gpars-users) - for general discussion

[gpars-developers](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gpars-developers) - for discussion of the library's implementation

The old Codehaus mailing lists are gone, but are archived here:

[user@gpars.codehaus.org](http://gpars-user-mailing-list.19372.n3.nabble.com/)

[dev@gpars.codehaus.org](http://gpars-developer-list.729030.n3.nabble.com/)

## Issue Tracker

There are GitHub issue trackers for each of the GPars projects:

[GPars](http://github.com/GPars/GPars/issues) (Implementation)

[gpars.github.io](https://github.com/GPars/gpars.github.io/issues) (Documentation)

The old Codehaus Jira tracker has now gone.

Pull requests are most welcome since they are easiest to work with
(see links to the GitHub projects below). Failing that, comments via
issues also welcome since that provides focus for upcoming work.

## Source Code Repository

The source code is available through the git repository hosted on GitHub

[GPars](http://github.com/GPars/GPars) (Implementation)

[gpars.github.io](https://github.com/GPars/gpars.github.io) (Documentation)
